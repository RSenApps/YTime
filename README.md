Revolutionizing the alarm clock with live traffic data. Built at Hack the North www.hackthenorth.com 
The premise of the app is that often people are setting their alarm clock to go somewhere, yet we still set it to a 
specific time. 
The app will use traffic data to periodically update its wakeup time to adjust for traffic conditions. 

What does the user gain: 
- increased sleeping time as it allows you to avoid creating a large “buffer time” to account for traffic 
- increased efficiency in the setting of alarms as the number of calculations and steps required of the users is significantly decreased. 

Major Use Cases: 
- Setting an alarm for a long commute 
- Setting an alarm for a new place or meeting the following day
